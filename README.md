# Assignment 2: Login Service

As part of the first assignment of the Web Services & Cloud Based Systems course we developed a RESTful service to shorten URLs.  

Implementation details, answer to question 3 and the group members contribution can be found in the ```report.pdf``` document in this repository.


## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the source code
```commandline
    git clone https://github.com/Web-Services-and-Cloud-Based-Systems-G9/login-service
```

2. Install dependencies (`pip3` can be replaced with `pip`, depending on your computer configurations)
```commandline
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run file ShortyURL.py (`python3` can be replaced with `python`, depending on your computer configurations)
```commandline
    python3 ShortyURL.py
```

4. The service will be in the 8081 port (http://127.0.0.1:8081). An user interface to use the web service can be found on the ```/home``` path

Tested on Python 3.8.9. Developed on Flask 2.1.1. Deployed with `waitress`. 

*Important Note: In the code you will find that we opted to use waitress instead of the default way of Flask of running the app. This is due to a weird behaviour in which Flask was cache-ing the responses and previous statuses of the API*


## Deployment

Our web service is deployed on a cloud provider (Heroku) and it is accesible through the following URL: https://shortyurl-ws.herokuapp.com/. A web client with an user interface can be found in: https://shortyurl-ws.herokuapp.com/home
